# SOLID1
First run for my C# SOLID design


1. Use Visual Studio 2017 to open the SOLID.Store.sln;
2. Rebuild the solution after VS 2017 is done loading the projects;
3. Run all unit tests. Unit test names are self-explanatory;
4. SOLID.Store.Entities contains Business Domain rules;
5. SOLID.Store.UseCases contains both Business Domain rules and Application Use Cases;
6. SOLID.Store.DataInfrastructure.MockData implements Dependency Inversion Rule and mock data infrastructure;
7. SOLID.Store.Entities.Test and SOLID.Store.UseCases.Test both contain unit tests;
